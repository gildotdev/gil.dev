I found out about [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/), a TUI for interacting with various LLM agents, a few weeks ago on Adam and Dax's podcast, [How About Tomorrow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAOQeB0oA0E). I installed it but I hadn't gotten around to try it out until today, after talking about it last night at [a meetup](https://space-coast.dev/coffee-meetup). Luckily, Adam and Dax were on [The Standup](https://youtu.be/VsTbgYawoVc) today talking about OpenCode, the controversy with its previous iteration, and how agents work.
